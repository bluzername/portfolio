September 2024 to December 2025. One full year of independence. Time to reflect.

## What I Built

**Products shipped:**
- TrustedChat (multi-LLM consensus AI)
- SwingTrade Pro (trading analysis tool)
- WhatsApp Formatter (Chrome extension)
- Synthetic Market Research system
- Multiple Telegram bots
- Instagram automation projects

**Consulting delivered:**
- 8 client engagements
- Spatial AI, multi-agent systems, perception architecture
- Mix of strategy and hands-on technical work

## What I Learned

### About Independence
- Freedom requires discipline
- Loneliness is real; combat it intentionally
- Income variability is stressful until you have runway
- The best part: choosing what to work on

### About Building
- Distribution is harder than building
- Ship fast, iterate based on feedback
- Users will surprise you
- Simple products that solve real problems > complex ambitious things

### About the AI Moment
- Multi-agent systems are powerful but complex
- Prompting is a skill worth mastering
- AI tools dramatically increase output
- The frontier moves fast; continuous learning required

## Financial Reality

**Income sources:**
- Consulting: 60%
- Products: 30%
- Other (teaching, advising): 10%

Not where I want to be (prefer products higher), but sustainable.

## Energy Assessment

**Energizing:**
- Building products from scratch
- Solving novel problems
- Working with AI capabilities
- Direct user feedback

**Draining:**
- Business development / sales
- Administrative tasks
- Scope creep in consulting
- Isolation during long building stretches

## What's Next

2026 focus:
- Scale one product to meaningful revenue
- Reduce consulting to 20% of time
- Write more (this blog)
- Build community around what I'm learning

The goal: products that generate income without my constant attention.

## Gratitude

Thanks to:
- Early product users who gave feedback
- Consulting clients who took a chance
- The AI community sharing knowledge openly
- Family supporting this unconventional path

Year two begins. Let's see what happens.

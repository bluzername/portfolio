July 2024 will mark four years at Meta. VPS is now a platform serving millions. Time for honest reflection.

## What We Built

VPS in 2023:
- Integrated in Quest 3 and Quest Pro
- 5,000+ mapped locations globally
- Millions of daily queries
- 100+ active developer partners
- Team of 75

From concept to critical infrastructure in four years.

## Career Evolution

**2020**: Individual contributor, proving the concept
**2021**: First-line manager, shipping MVP
**2022**: Senior manager, scaling team and system
**2023**: Director-level scope, strategy and partnerships

The role changed more than the technology.

## What I'm Proud Of

**The system works**: Real users rely on VPS daily for real experiences.

**The team I built**: Strong leaders, strong culture, sustainable pace.

**Privacy-first architecture**: Proved you can build spatial AI without surveillance.

**Synthetic data impact**: Extended Magic Leap learnings to Meta scale.

## What Remains Unfinished

**Indoor**: Still not cracked. The holy grail remains elusive.

**Universal coverage**: Most places still unmapped. Long tail is very long.

**True real-time**: Latency good but not invisible. More work needed.

**Economic viability**: Mapping costs still too high for long-term sustainability.

## The Learning Curve

Honest assessment: my learning rate has slowed.

Years 1-2: Steep learning - new domain, new company, new scale
Years 3-4: Incremental learning - optimization, polish, politics

I'm better at what I do, but doing similar things.

## Thinking About What's Next

Questions I'm asking:
- Is there more I can uniquely contribute here?
- What would I regret not trying?
- Where could my experience have maximum impact?

Not decided, but thinking seriously.

## The AI Moment

We're in an inflection point for AI:
- LLMs changing everything
- Multi-agent systems emerging
- AI-native products possible

My perception/spatial expertise is valuable, but the frontier is moving. Want to be at the frontier, not optimizing behind it.

## Gratitude

Regardless of what's next:
- Meta gave me resources to build at scale
- The team taught me leadership
- The problems stretched me technically

Four years well spent, whatever comes next.

18 months since joining Meta, 12 since focusing fully on VPS. Time to assess.

## What We Shipped

**VPS Developer Preview**:
- Live in 15 countries
- 500+ mapped locations
- Used by 50+ developer partners
- Integrated in Quest experiences

**Technical Achievements**:
- Sub-meter outdoor localization
- under 1 second query latency
- Privacy-preserving architecture
- Learned feature pipeline

**Scale**:
- Processing 10M+ images per day
- Serving 1M+ localization queries per day
- 50-person team

## What Went Well

**Team building**: Hired strong people, promoted good managers, maintained culture.

**Shipping velocity**: Launched MVP in 6 months, iterated quarterly.

**Cross-functional partnership**: Worked well with Quest platform, privacy, policy.

**Technical foundation**: Architecture choices enabling scale and iteration.

## What Didn't Go Well

**Indoor localization**: Behind plan. Harder than expected.

**Mapping efficiency**: Still too expensive per location. Economics don't scale.

**Developer experience**: SDK needs polish. Onboarding is confusing.

**Accuracy consistency**: Works great in some conditions, poorly in others.

## Lessons Learned

**Privacy is a design constraint, not a feature**: Every decision must consider privacy from the start.

**Coverage beats accuracy**: Developers want it to work everywhere more than perfectly anywhere.

**Operations at scale is different**: What works for 10 locations doesn't work for 500.

**Meta's resources are real**: Infrastructure, talent, and reach enable things impossible elsewhere.

## Looking to 2022

**Priorities**:
1. Indoor localization launch
2. Mapping cost reduction (10x)
3. Developer self-service tools
4. Quest 3 integration (next hardware)

**Team growth**: 50 → 80 (focused growth, not exponential)

**Technical bets**:
- Neural rendering for map compression
- Multi-modal fusion (WiFi + visual)
- Crowdsourced mapping at scale

## Personal Reflection

**What energizes me**: Building systems that ship to millions, solving hard technical problems, growing talent.

**What drains me**: Meeting overhead, cross-org alignment, politics.

**Growth edge**: Delegating more, thinking bigger, influencing without authority.

## Overall Assessment

VPS is real and growing. The path to ubiquitous spatial computing is clearer than a year ago.

We're not there yet - gaps in indoor, rural areas, edge cases. But the foundation is solid.

Excited for year two.

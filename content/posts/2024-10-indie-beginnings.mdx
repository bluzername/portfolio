One month since leaving Meta. The quiet is strange after years of constant input.

## The Immediate Difference

**No calendar**: For the first time in years, my time is truly mine.

**No Slack**: The constant notification stream stopped. It took a week to stop checking reflexively.

**No hierarchy**: Decisions are mine. No approvals, no alignment, no waiting.

**No resources**: Also mine. No cloud compute, no ML infrastructure, no team.

## What I'm Doing

### Consulting
A few companies reached out. Taking selective engagements:
- Spatial computing strategy
- Perception system architecture
- AI product direction

~20 hours/week. Enough to stay sharp and connected, not enough to prevent building.

### Building
Started three small projects:
- An AI tool I wanted at Meta but couldn't build
- An experiment in synthetic data for a new domain
- A prototype exploring LLM + spatial computing

None are businesses yet. All are learning.

### Learning
Catching up on what I missed while heads-down:
- LLM developments (the field moved fast)
- Multi-agent systems (fascinating architectures)
- AI tooling (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

Reading, building, experimenting.

## What Surprised Me

**The quiet is productive**: Without meetings, I can think deeply again.

**Ideas need constraints**: Infinite possibility is paralyzing. Picking constraints helps.

**Identity untangling**: "What do you do?" is harder to answer now. Working on being okay with that.

**Community matters**: Miss the daily interaction with smart people. Seeking it in new ways.

## What's Next

Not rushing to decide. Experimenting for at least Q4 2024.

Questions I'm exploring:
- What problems can I uniquely solve?
- What would I regret not trying?
- What work energizes vs drains me?

The freedom to ask these questions is the luxury of this moment.

We've been exploring an unconventional approach to eye tracking that exploits laser speckle patterns. It's now mature enough to file a patent.

## What is Speckle?

When coherent light (laser) illuminates a rough surface, the scattered light creates an interference pattern of bright and dark spots called "speckle." This pattern is:

- **Unique to the surface**: Like a fingerprint
- **Sensitive to viewing angle**: Changes with observer position
- **High spatial frequency**: Fine-grained structure

## Speckle on the Eye

The human cornea and iris have surface texture that creates speckle when illuminated with coherent NIR light.

Key insight: **as the eye rotates, the speckle pattern translates**.

If we can track the speckle pattern's movement, we can track eye rotation with very high precision.

## Implementation Concept

```
VCSEL Illumination → Corneal Reflection → Speckle Pattern →
High-Speed Camera → Pattern Correlation → Gaze Estimation
```

### Illumination
Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs):
- Coherent enough for speckle generation
- Eye-safe at low power
- Compact and efficient

### Imaging
Capture speckle pattern on specialized camera:
- Small pixel size to resolve speckle (≤3μm)
- High frame rate for fast eye movements (>200Hz)
- NIR sensitivity matching VCSEL wavelength

### Pattern Tracking
Cross-correlation between consecutive frames:
```
offset = argmax(correlation(frame_n, frame_n-1))
rotation = f(offset, geometry)
```

Sub-pixel correlation gives sub-degree rotation precision.

## Advantages Over Traditional Eye Tracking

**Resolution**: Traditional glint/pupil tracking limited by image resolution. Speckle provides sub-pixel precision.

**Speed**: Pattern correlation is computationally simpler than feature detection.

**Robustness**: Less sensitive to pupil dilation, partial occlusion.

## Challenges

**Speckle decorrelation**: If surface changes (tears, blinking), pattern changes. Need to detect and handle decorrelation events.

**Hardware requirements**: Needs coherent source and high-resolution sensor - adds cost and power.

**Eye safety**: Coherent radiation requires careful safety analysis. Must meet IEC 62471 Class 1.

## Patent Strategy

We're filing on:
1. Method of eye tracking using speckle correlation
2. Apparatus with specific VCSEL + sensor configuration
3. Decorrelation detection and recovery

The combination of eye safety constraints, speckle imaging requirements, and correlation algorithms is novel.

## Path Forward

Current status: bench prototype showing 0.1° accuracy, limited to slow movements.

Needed for product:
- Faster correlation (GPU/DSP implementation)
- Reliable decorrelation handling
- Integration with display optics

This may not make V1 product, but it's promising for future iterations.

Magic Leap is pivoting toward enterprise. The perception requirements shift in interesting ways.

## Consumer vs Enterprise

**Consumer priorities:**
1. Price (must be affordable)
2. Form factor (must be wearable socially)
3. Content (must have compelling experiences)
4. Ease of use (must work out of box)

**Enterprise priorities:**
1. Reliability (must work every time)
2. Integration (must connect to existing systems)
3. ROI (must save more than it costs)
4. Support (must have escalation path)

Perception implications differ significantly.

## Reliability Requirements

Enterprise: "If the tracking fails during a surgical procedure, that's not acceptable."

Consumer tolerance: under 1% tracking loss per hour
Enterprise requirement: under 0.01% tracking loss per hour

How do we achieve this?
- **Controlled environments**: Enterprise can mandate good lighting, no clutter
- **Custom calibration**: On-site calibration for specific spaces
- **Redundancy**: Multiple sensor modalities, failover paths
- **Monitoring**: Real-time health dashboards, predictive maintenance

## Integration Requirements

Enterprise systems don't exist in isolation:
- **CAD integration**: Overlay 3D models from existing design tools
- **IoT integration**: Visualize data from sensors, machines, systems
- **Backend integration**: Connect to enterprise databases, workflows
- **Authentication**: Integrate with corporate identity management

Perception implications:
- Fiducial markers for CAD alignment
- QR codes for object identification
- Consistent coordinate systems across visits

## Environment Considerations

Enterprise environments differ from homes:

**Factories**:
- Harsh lighting (bright overheads, shadows)
- Metal surfaces (reflections, multi-path)
- Dynamic scenes (machinery, people moving)
- Hazardous areas (can't touch walls for mapping)

**Healthcare**:
- Sterile requirements (no touching surfaces)
- Variable lighting (procedure lights)
- Moving people (medical staff)
- Regulatory constraints (HIPAA, etc.)

**Field service**:
- Outdoor operation (sunlight, weather)
- Variable locations (customer sites)
- Connectivity constraints (no cloud assumption)

Each vertical needs perception adaptations.

## Perception Customization

One size doesn't fit all. We're building:

**Environment profiles**: Preset configurations for common scenarios
- "Clean room mode": High-frequency lighting handling
- "Outdoor mode": Sunlight-robust algorithms
- "Dynamic mode": Fast adaptation to scene changes

**Calibration tools**: Enterprise IT can calibrate for their specific spaces
- Site survey workflow
- Persistent map management
- Quality verification

**API access**: Enterprises want deeper integration
- Raw sensor access (with consent)
- Custom tracking algorithms (with support)
- Data export for analytics

## Business Model Impact

Enterprise changes the perception team's work:
- Longer support timelines (years, not months)
- Customer-specific bug fixes
- On-site deployment support
- Certification requirements (ISO, medical, etc.)

It's a different rhythm than consumer product development. Adjusting.

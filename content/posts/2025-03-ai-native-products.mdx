Six months of building AI-native products. The principles are different from AI-enhanced products.

## AI-Enhanced vs AI-Native

**AI-Enhanced** (most products today):
- Core value exists without AI
- AI improves experience
- AI can fail; product still works
- Example: Search with AI summaries

**AI-Native** (what I'm building):
- Core value IS the AI
- Without AI, there's no product
- AI must be reliable enough to trust
- Example: AI that replaces a workflow

Different mental models, different design principles.

## Principles I've Learned

### 1. Design for Uncertainty
AI outputs are probabilistic. Design assumes uncertainty:
- Confidence indicators
- Human-in-the-loop for high-stakes
- Graceful fallbacks
- Clear error states

### 2. Latency is UX
AI inference takes time. Make waiting acceptable:
- Stream outputs (feel faster)
- Progressive enhancement (partial results)
- Background processing when possible
- Set expectations explicitly

### 3. Cost is Architecture
API costs shape what's possible:
- Can't call GPT-4 on every keystroke
- Caching and batching essential
- Cheaper models for routing/filtering
- Cost awareness throughout stack

### 4. Evaluation is Product
How do you know AI is working?
- Build evaluation into the product
- User feedback as training signal
- A/B test model changes
- Metrics that matter (not just accuracy)

### 5. Prompts are Code
Prompt engineering is software engineering:
- Version control prompts
- Test prompts systematically
- Document prompt decisions
- Review prompt changes

## Products I've Built

**Synthetic Market Research** (shipped):
- Multi-agent concept validation
- ~$2 per analysis
- Validated against 9,000+ human responses

**TrustedChat** (shipped):
- Multi-LLM consensus
- More reliable answers
- In active use

**Several prototypes** (learning):
- Telegram bots for content
- Automation tools
- Experiments in various domains

## What's Hard

**Reliability**: 90% accuracy isn't enough when users expect 99%+.

**Evaluation**: How do you measure "good" for generative outputs?

**Iteration speed**: Model changes can break everything.

**User trust**: Users don't know when to trust AI.

## What's Exciting

We're in early innings. The tools are new, the patterns are emerging, the opportunities are vast.

Being independent lets me experiment faster than any big company could.

More to build.

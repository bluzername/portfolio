Outdoor VPS is hard. Indoor VPS is harder. GPS doesn't work indoors, and buildings look more alike than streets do.

## Why Indoor is Harder

### No GPS Fallback
Outdoors: If VPS fails, fall back to 3m GPS.
Indoors: If VPS fails, you have nothing.

The system must work, always.

### Feature Ambiguity
Outdoor features: Buildings, street signs, unique architecture.
Indoor features: White walls, drop ceilings, identical corridors.

Office floors are nearly identical to other floors. Retail stores follow templates. Airports have repetitive gates.

### Limited Viewpoint Diversity
Outdoor capture: Many viewpoints from streets, photos from tourists.
Indoor capture: Fewer photos, more restricted viewpoints.

Less training data, harder coverage.

### Lighting Variability
Outdoor: Daylight is predictable (sun position).
Indoor: Artificial lighting varies by venue, flickers, creates harsh shadows.

### Scale Challenges
One building: Thousands of features.
All buildings: Billions of features, many duplicates.

False matches across buildings are common.

## Technical Approaches

### Hierarchical Localization
First: Which building? (Coarse - WiFi, BLE, or image global descriptor)
Then: Which floor? (Medium - image retrieval within building)
Finally: Where on floor? (Fine - feature matching)

Each level reduces search space.

### Semantic Features
Instead of generic features, use semantic understanding:
- "This is a Starbucks" narrows locations dramatically
- Room types (bathroom, elevator, conference) provide context
- Signage and text are highly distinctive

Combining geometric and semantic features.

### Multi-Modal Fusion
Visual alone isn't enough. Fuse with:
- WiFi fingerprinting (room-level accuracy)
- BLE beacons (if present)
- Magnetic field signatures
- Pedestrian dead reckoning

Each modality contributes. Fusion handles individual failures.

## Mapping Indoor Spaces

Challenges:
- Access control (can't just walk into offices)
- Privacy sensitivity (people, screens, documents)
- Dynamic environments (furniture moves daily)
- Scale (more indoor space than outdoor surface)

Approaches:
- Partner with venue operators
- Mapping-as-a-service for businesses
- Robotics for systematic capture
- Crowd-sourced with strong privacy controls

## Current State

Indoor VPS in development:
- Working in controlled environments (Meta offices)
- Accuracy: 30cm in mapped areas
- Robustness: 85% success rate

Not ready for external launch. Key gaps:
- Multi-floor confusion
- Similar-room discrimination
- Mapping efficiency

Targeting indoor beta in 2022.

First week at Meta. Everything is bigger.

## Scale Shock

Magic Leap: ~2,000 employees, under 100 in perception
Meta: ~50,000+ employees, thousands in Reality Labs

The numbers are one thing. The implications are another:
- More specialists (someone owns JUST the depth filtering)
- More process (reviews, approvals, documentation)
- More resources (compute, headcount, budget)
- More complexity (coordination, alignment, communication)

## The VPS Mission

I'm here to build and lead the Visual Positioning Service (VPS) - enabling XR devices to understand where they are in the world.

The vision:
- Any XR device can localize in any mapped space
- 6DoF tracking relative to persistent world maps
- Centimeter-level accuracy outdoors
- Works across Quest headsets and future devices

This extends everything I did at Magic Leap to global scale.

## Different Challenges

**Scale of data**: Meta has billions of geolocated photos from apps like Instagram and Facebook. This data could bootstrap worldwide mapping.

**Scale of deployment**: Quest has millions of users. Features ship to everyone at once.

**Scale of infrastructure**: Google-class systems for storage, compute, ML training.

At Magic Leap, we built custom everything. At Meta, we build on massive infrastructure.

## Familiar Patterns

Despite the scale difference, core problems are the same:
- How do you build accurate 3D maps efficiently?
- How do you localize quickly on constrained hardware?
- How do you handle changing environments?
- How do you protect user privacy?

The physics doesn't change because the company is bigger.

## First Impressions

**Talent density is high**: Every meeting has people who are world experts in something.

**Documentation is extensive**: Everything has a wiki page, design doc, or review thread.

**Process is real**: Shipping anything requires multiple approval gates.

**Ambition is extreme**: The roadmaps assume success at everything.

## Learning Mode

First 90 days: listen, learn, build relationships.
- Understanding existing systems
- Meeting stakeholders across org
- Identifying where I can add value
- Building credibility through small wins

The temptation to immediately redesign everything is strong. Resisting it.

## What I Bring

Experience that's relevant:
- End-to-end perception system design
- Synthetic data for perception training
- Hardware-software co-design
- Shipping under constraints

What I need to learn:
- Meta's codebase and tools
- Organizational dynamics
- How decisions get made here
- What's already been tried

Excited and humbled. The learning curve is steep again. That's the point.

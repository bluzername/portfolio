A year ago, we had working prototypes. Today, we have a shipping product and thousands of users. The lessons came fast.

## Shipping is the Test

Everything before ship was theory. The real test came when devices reached customers who didn't care about our constraints.

**Excuses don't ship**: Users don't care that outdoor SLAM is hard. They expect it to work.

**Edge cases are mainline**: That weird lighting condition we saw once in testing? Users encounter it daily.

**Integration is everything**: Each component passed its tests. The system still had bugs.

## What I Got Right

**Investing in synthetic data**: The team I pushed to create in 2017 is now essential. Eye tracking and hand tracking couldn't have shipped without it.

**Prioritizing robustness over features**: We cut features to make core tracking rock-solid. Users forgive missing features; they don't forgive crashes.

**Building calibration infrastructure early**: Production calibration "just worked" because we invested heavily in 2017.

## What I Got Wrong

**Underestimating field diversity**: Our test environments were too clean, too controlled. Real homes are chaotic.

**Over-optimizing for benchmarks**: Our SLAM was best-in-class on standard datasets. Users don't live in standard datasets.

**Neglecting user messaging**: When perception fails, users don't know why. Better feedback could have prevented much frustration.

## Leadership Lessons

**Crunch has diminishing returns**: After 6 weeks of sustained crunch, productivity went negative. Fresh eyes found bugs faster.

**Visible progress matters**: During the dark tunnel of debugging, weekly demos of fixed issues kept morale alive.

**Protect the team from chaos**: Leadership's job is to absorb organizational turbulence so the team can focus.

**Celebrate shipping**: We didn't celebrate enough. After months of pain, we shipped and immediately moved to the next crisis. Should have paused.

## Technical Insights

**Power is the ultimate constraint**: Every optimization eventually comes back to power. It limits clock speeds, thermal capacity, battery life, form factor.

**Calibration is half the system**: Brilliant algorithms mean nothing without brilliant calibration. Invest accordingly.

**Data pipelines are strategic assets**: The team that can generate and curate training data faster wins.

## Looking to 2019

Priorities:
- V1 software updates (fixing field issues)
- V2 sensor architecture decisions
- Scaling synthetic data capability
- Building the team for the next phase

The bar is higher now. We shipped something. Next time we need to ship something great.

Magic Leap taught me what shipping really means. Whatever comes next, that lesson travels with me.

Six months since joining Meta. Time to reflect on what's different at this scale.

## What Surprised Me

**Process isn't bureaucracy**: I expected big-company process to slow things down. Often it's the opposite - well-designed process prevents chaos at scale.

**Expertise depth**: Whatever problem you have, someone at Meta has solved something similar. Finding them is the challenge.

**Infrastructure leverage**: Years of infrastructure investment means features that would take months elsewhere take weeks here.

**Ambition level**: The roadmaps assume we'll solve problems that don't have known solutions. Bold, occasionally unrealistic.

## What I'm Learning

**Navigation skills**: Finding the right people, teams, and decisions requires active networking. Org charts don't tell the whole story.

**Influence without authority**: Can't just decree decisions. Have to build coalitions, make the case, earn buy-in.

**Long planning horizons**: Decisions made now affect products launching in 3+ years. Think further ahead.

**Cross-functional coordination**: Design, research, policy, legal, communications all have legitimate input. Technical correctness isn't sufficient.

## VPS Progress

**Team**: Started at 5, now at 15. Hired well, building strong foundation.

**Architecture**: VPS system design reviewed and approved. Implementation started.

**Prototypes**: Basic localization working in demo environments. Nowhere near production.

**Partnerships**: Aligned with Quest team, smart glasses team, mapping infrastructure team.

**Challenges**: Data pipeline is the bottleneck. Privacy review is rigorous (rightfully).

## Cultural Observations

**Move fast**: Still feels true despite company size. Bias toward action.

**Openness**: Internal communication is remarkably transparent. Most docs accessible to everyone.

**Feedback**: Direct feedback is cultural norm. People tell you what they think.

**Mission**: People genuinely believe in connecting the world. It's not just marketing.

## Missing from Magic Leap

**Startup urgency**: At Magic Leap, every decision felt existential. Meta has more room for error.

**End-to-end ownership**: At Magic Leap, I owned hardware to software. Here, I own one component in a larger system.

**Scrappiness**: Magic Leap made do with less. Meta has resources, but sometimes that means solving problems with headcount rather than cleverness.

## What I Bring

**Systems thinking**: Understanding how components interact, not just individual optimization.

**Hardware empathy**: Knowing what's possible on device, not just in cloud.

**Shipping experience**: Having launched real products, not just prototypes.

**Synthetic data expertise**: This is still novel at Meta scale.

## Looking to 2021

Goals:
- VPS MVP running on Quest
- Synthetic data platform operational
- Team scaled to 30+
- First external partnerships for mapping

It's ambitious. But that's why I came here.

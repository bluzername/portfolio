Today is my last day at Meta. Four years and two months since I joined to build something that didn't exist.

## By the Numbers

**Team**: 5 → 75 people
**Locations mapped**: 0 → 10,000+
**Daily queries**: 0 → millions
**Products shipped**: Quest Pro, Quest 3, developer platform
**Patents filed**: 2 (one already granted)

Numbers don't capture the full story, but they're one measure.

## What I'll Miss

**The team**: Brilliant, dedicated people who became friends.

**The resources**: Ability to try things at scale.

**The mission**: Spatial computing matters, and we moved it forward.

**The community**: Reality Labs has remarkable talent density.

## What I Won't Miss

**The politics**: Alignment across organizations was exhausting.

**The meetings**: So many meetings about meetings.

**The pace of decision-making**: Large organizations are slow.

**The distance from users**: Layers between me and the people using what we built.

## Lessons That Travel

**Data is strategy**: Whoever controls training data controls ML outcomes.

**Privacy is design**: Build it in, don't bolt it on.

**Platforms are different**: Developer experience is as important as end-user experience.

**Teams > Individuals**: Strong teams outlast strong individuals.

**Shipping teaches**: You learn more from launching than from planning.

## Gratitude List

- The team members who trusted me to lead
- The managers who gave me space to build
- The partners who collaborated across orgs
- The users who gave feedback
- My family who supported late nights and work trips

## What's Next

Taking Q4 2024 to:
- Reset and recover
- Explore opportunities
- Build some things myself
- Decide where to focus

Not joining another company immediately. Want to be intentional about what's next.

## Closing Thoughts

Meta gave me the platform to build something significant. VPS exists because of what we did together. That's permanent, regardless of what I do next.

To everyone at Meta Reality Labs: thank you. The work continues. I'll be cheering from the outside.

Now, into the unknown.

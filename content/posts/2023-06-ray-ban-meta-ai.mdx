Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are launching with Meta AI built in. We're preparing VPS integration for the next generation.

## Glasses vs Headset Constraints

| Constraint | Quest 3 | Ray-Ban Meta |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Weight | 500g | 40g |
| Battery | 3-4 hrs | 4+ hrs always-on |
| Compute | High-end mobile | Ultra-low power |
| Cameras | Multi-camera rig | Small forward camera |
| Use case | Sessions | Always-on |

Orders of magnitude harder.

## Glasses VPS Architecture

Can't run Quest VPS architecture on glasses. Complete rethink:

**Sparse queries**: Once per minute, not continuous
**Cloud-heavy**: Minimal on-device processing
**Semantic focus**: "Where am I?" not "Exactly where am I?"
**Multi-modal**: GPS + WiFi + visual combined

Different product, different architecture.

## Privacy Amplified

Glasses worn in public continuously raise privacy stakes:
- Bystanders don't know when cameras active
- Social norms around glasses different than headsets
- Always-on means more potential capture

Even more stringent privacy requirements:
- Extremely limited data retention
- Clear indicators during any capture
- Location only when user explicitly requests

## Use Cases

Different from Quest:
- **Contextual AI**: "What building is this?" → VPS identifies location → AI provides info
- **Navigation**: Step-by-step walking directions with audio
- **Memory**: "Remember I parked here" with visual confirmation
- **Social**: Share location with context ("I'm at this café")

Less about AR overlay, more about AI context.

## Technical Approach

**Ultra-efficient features**: New network architecture targeting 5mW inference
**Compressed queries**: Send minimal data for cloud matching
**Predictive localization**: Guess location before query completes
**Graceful degradation**: GPS fallback is acceptable

## Timeline

Ray-Ban Meta launching 2023 without VPS.
Next generation (2024+) targeted for VPS integration.

Using this generation to:
- Understand real sensor characteristics
- Collect training data (consented)
- Refine ultra-low-power algorithms
- Build glasses-specific maps

Preparing for the future where glasses have spatial awareness.

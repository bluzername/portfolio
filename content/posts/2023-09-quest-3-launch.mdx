Quest 3 launched with VPS enabled by default for MR experiences. Our largest deployment by far.

## Launch Numbers

First week:
- 500K+ devices activated
- 2M+ VPS queries served
- 50K+ unique locations attempted
- 87% success rate in covered areas

Scale we've never seen before.

## What Worked

**Infrastructure scaling**: Invested heavily in Q2-Q3. Handled launch load without incident.

**On-device caching**: Popular locations cached on device. 40% of queries served locally.

**Developer readiness**: Launch apps worked. First-party MR experiences performed well.

**User experience**: When VPS works, users don't notice it (which is good).

## What Didn't

**Coverage gaps**: Many users in unmapped areas. "VPS not available" frustrating.

**Outdoor sunlight**: Still challenging. Accuracy drops in bright conditions.

**Onboarding confusion**: Users don't understand what VPS does or when it's working.

**Power consumption**: Higher than target in continuous MR mode.

## User Feedback Themes

**Positive**:
- "Content stays in place - feels like magic"
- "Navigation actually works"
- "Shared MR with friend was amazing"

**Negative**:
- "Doesn't work at my house" (not mapped)
- "Glitchy outside in the afternoon" (sunlight)
- "Drains battery too fast"

## Rapid Response

First month fixes:
- Expanded coverage to top-requested areas
- Improved sunlight robustness (server-side model update)
- Better error messaging
- Power optimization patch

Advantages of server-side components: can update without device update.

## Scale Lessons

1. **Long tail is really long**: The locations users want are incredibly diverse. Can't map everything.

2. **Good enough beats perfect**: 80% accuracy everywhere beats 95% in limited areas.

3. **Failure UX matters as much as success**: How VPS fails determines user perception.

4. **Self-service is essential**: Can't manually map everywhere users want.

## Looking Forward

Quest 3 establishes VPS as core infrastructure. Now the question is expansion:
- More coverage (crowdsourced + partnerships)
- Better indoor (still behind)
- Glasses integration (next frontier)

Three years from concept to consumer scale. The foundation is set.

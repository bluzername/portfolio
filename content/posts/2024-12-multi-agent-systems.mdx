The most interesting AI developments aren't single models - they're systems of agents working together. This is where I'm focusing.

## Why Multi-Agent?

Single LLMs hit limits:
- Context windows are finite
- Single perspective limits reasoning
- Complex tasks need decomposition
- Specialization beats generalization

Multi-agent systems address these:
- Multiple agents, multiple contexts
- Debate and verification between agents
- Task decomposition to specialized agents
- Best model for each sub-task

## Architecture Patterns

### Orchestrator + Specialists
```
Orchestrator (planning, routing)
├── Research Agent (search, read)
├── Code Agent (write, test)
├── Review Agent (evaluate, critique)
└── Output Agent (synthesize, present)
```

Each agent optimized for its task. Orchestrator coordinates.

### Debate Architectures
```
Agent A: Proposes solution
Agent B: Critiques solution
Agent A: Addresses critique
...
Evaluator: Judges final quality
```

Dialectic improves outcomes.

### Swarm Patterns
```
Many similar agents work in parallel
Aggregate results statistically
Outliers flagged for review
```

Scale through parallelism.

## What I'm Building

A synthetic market research system:
- Generate product concepts from briefs
- Create synthetic personas (100+)
- Simulate market response
- Calculate PMF metrics
- Iterate until convergence

Multiple agents with different roles:
- Concept generator
- Persona simulator
- Response aggregator
- Analysis synthesizer

Early results: Useful insights for ~$2 in API costs.

## Technical Challenges

**Coordination overhead**: Agents talking to each other consumes tokens and time.

**Error propagation**: One agent's mistake compounds through the system.

**Debugging complexity**: Which agent caused the problem?

**Cost management**: Multi-agent = multi-model calls = cost multiplication.

## Connection to Perception

Interesting parallel to perception systems:
- Multiple sensors (agents) with different modalities
- Fusion combines information
- Confidence scoring for reliability
- Graceful degradation when components fail

My perception background informs agent architecture thinking.

## What's Next

Deepening multi-agent exploration:
- More complex workflows
- Better evaluation methods
- Cost optimization
- Real user testing

This feels like the frontier I was seeking.

After years in defense and cyber-security, I've made a leap (pun intended) into consumer hardware. Magic Leap is attempting something that has never been done at scale: a wearable device that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world.

## Why Mixed Reality?

The fundamental technical challenges here are extraordinary:

1. **Display technology** that can project photons directly into the eye at multiple focal planes
2. **Real-time environment understanding** - the device must know exactly where it is and what surrounds it
3. **Ultra-low latency** - any delay between head movement and display update causes nausea
4. **All-day battery life** in a form factor people will actually wear

Coming from systems where power consumption was measured in watts, not milliwatts, the constraints here are humbling.

## The Perception Problem

My initial focus is on the perception sensor suite. For MR to work, the device needs:

- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** - building a 3D map while tracking the device's position within it
- **Depth sensing** - understanding the geometry of the environment in real-time
- **Eye tracking** - knowing where the user is looking for foveated rendering and interaction

Each of these is a PhD-level problem. Solving all three simultaneously on embedded hardware with thermal constraints? That's the challenge.

## Initial Observations

The team here is exceptional - optical physicists, SLAM researchers, display engineers. But I'm already seeing a familiar pattern: brilliant specialists who don't always speak the same language. Part of my role will be bridging these domains.

More technical deep-dives to come as I get hands-on with the sensor architecture.

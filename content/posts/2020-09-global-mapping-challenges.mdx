To localize anywhere, you need maps everywhere. Building 3D maps at global scale is a data problem before it's an algorithm problem.

## Data Sources

### Crowd-Sourced Images
Meta has access to billions of geolocated images from Facebook, Instagram, and user-shared content.

Potential: Massive coverage, especially in populated areas.
Challenges: Variable quality, privacy constraints, not uniformly distributed.

### Dedicated Capture
Vehicles or pedestrians with calibrated camera rigs capturing specific areas.

Potential: High quality, controlled conditions, known accuracy.
Challenges: Expensive, doesn't scale to everywhere.

### Third-Party Maps
Partnerships with mapping companies, government data, open-source maps.

Potential: Professional quality, existing coverage.
Challenges: Licensing, update frequency, format compatibility.

### User Contributions
AR device users contribute mapping data during normal use.

Potential: Always fresh, covers where users actually go.
Challenges: Quality control, privacy, opt-in rates.

## Quality vs Coverage Trade-off

**High-quality mapping** (survey-grade equipment):
- Centimeter accuracy
- Complete coverage within capture area
- Expensive: $100+ per square meter

**Crowd-sourced mapping** (user photos):
- Meter-level accuracy (before refinement)
- Spotty coverage, depends on photo density
- Cheap: marginal cost of processing

We need both: crowd-sourced for coverage, high-quality for validation.

## The Long Tail Problem

80% of the world's photos are of 1% of locations.

Tourist sites: millions of photos
Suburban neighborhoods: almost nothing

For VPS to be useful everywhere, we need maps everywhere. That means solving the coverage long tail.

Approaches:
- Incentivize capture in under-mapped areas
- Lower quality thresholds for sparse regions
- Fallback to GPS + VIO when maps unavailable

## Privacy at Scale

Using public photos for mapping raises questions:
- Bystander faces in images
- Private property visible from public spaces
- Aggregation revealing patterns

Protections:
- Face blurring in all processing
- License plate detection and removal
- Opt-out mechanisms for property owners
- Differential privacy for location aggregates

Privacy isn't a feature - it's a constraint on everything we build.

## Processing Pipeline

Raw images → map requires:
1. Filtering (quality, duplicates, inappropriate content)
2. Georegistration (align to coordinate system)
3. Structure from Motion (sparse 3D)
4. Multi-View Stereo (dense 3D)
5. Semantic labeling (what things are)
6. Map optimization (consistency, accuracy)

At billions of images, every step is an infrastructure challenge.

Current state: processing capacity for 10M images/day. Need 10x that.

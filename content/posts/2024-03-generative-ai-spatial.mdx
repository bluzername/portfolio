The AI landscape shifted dramatically with LLMs. How does this change spatial computing and VPS?

## Traditional Spatial AI

Pre-LLM spatial understanding:
- Feature detection (SIFT, learned features)
- Geometric reasoning (SLAM, SfM)
- Object recognition (CNN classifiers)

Each task: specialized model, specialized training data.

## LLM-Era Opportunities

### Semantic Understanding
LLMs can interpret what's in a scene:
```
Image → Vision-Language Model → "A busy café with outdoor seating"
```

Rich semantic understanding without task-specific training.

### Scene Description for Localization
Instead of feature matching:
```
Query: "I see a red brick building with a blue awning next to a parking meter"
Match: Find locations matching this description
```

Language as the interface to spatial databases.

### Contextual Awareness
LLM-powered AR assistant:
```
User: "Where should I sit?"
System: [Uses VPS for location] + [Uses LLM for reasoning]
Response: "The table by the window has the best view and is in shade"
```

Spatial awareness + language understanding = useful AI.

## Technical Integration

### VPS + Vision-Language Models
```
Camera → VPS (where am I?) → Scene understanding (what's here?) →
LLM reasoning (what does it mean?) → User value
```

Each component does what it's best at.

### Challenges
**Latency**: LLMs are slow. Spatial computing needs real-time.
**Cost**: LLM inference is expensive. Can't run on every frame.
**Grounding**: LLMs can hallucinate. Spatial ground truth provides checks.

## Experiments Underway

We're prototyping:
- LLM-described location matching (language-based VPS)
- Generative scene completion (fill in unmapped areas)
- Conversational spatial search ("find me a coffee shop with seating")

Early results promising but not production-ready.

## Implications for VPS

VPS might evolve from:
- Feature database → Semantic scene database
- Coordinate output → Contextual understanding output
- Developer API → End-user experience

The goal remains: help devices understand where they are. The methods may change dramatically.

## Personal Interest

This intersection - spatial AI + generative AI - is where I want to be.

VPS expertise + LLM opportunities = unique perspective.

Starting to think about what this means for my next chapter.

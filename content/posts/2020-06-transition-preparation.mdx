One month until I leave. The challenge: how do you transfer four years of accumulated knowledge?

## The Knowledge Inventory

What do I know that isn't written down?

**Technical decisions**: Why certain architectures were chosen. What was tried and rejected.

**Historical context**: What problems were we solving? What constraints existed then?

**People knowledge**: Who knows what? Who should be consulted on which decisions?

**Political landscape**: Which teams to align with? Which stakeholders have concerns?

**Failure patterns**: What went wrong before? What warning signs to watch for?

Most of this exists only in my head.

## Documentation Sprint

Spending the last month writing:

**Architecture rationale document**: Not just "what" but "why" for every major design decision.

**Decision log**: Every significant choice with context, alternatives considered, and what would change our mind.

**Tribal knowledge capture**: One-pagers on topics people frequently ask me about.

**Key contact list**: For every external dependency, who to talk to and how to approach them.

**Risk register**: Known risks, potential mitigations, early warning signs.

## Training Sessions

Documentation isn't enough. Running training sessions:

**Technical deep-dives**: Walking through code paths with the engineers who'll own them.

**Stakeholder intros**: Introducing successors to key relationships.

**War stories**: Sharing past failures so new leaders don't repeat them.

**Q&A sessions**: Open time for any question, recorded for future reference.

## Successor Preparation

My successor (promoted from within) is shadowing me:
- Present in all my meetings
- CC'd on all emails
- Making joint decisions, then solo decisions with my review

Gradual handoff: I'm stepping back incrementally, available for questions but not driving.

## What Can't Be Transferred

Some things don't transfer:
- **Intuition**: Years of pattern-matching that informs judgment
- **Relationships**: Trust built over time with individuals
- **Reputation**: Credibility earned through delivery

These rebuild over time. The successor will develop their own.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**The hero dependency**: If only one person can do something, that's a bug. Building redundancy.

**The knowledge silo**: If it's only in one head, it's not organizational knowledge. Writing it down.

**The surprise departure**: Giving plenty of notice, making transition explicit.

**The lingering presence**: After I leave, I'm gone. Available for rare consultations, but not day-to-day.

## Emotional Component

Beyond the logistics, there's emotion:
- Attachment to work I built
- Relationships with people I care about
- Identity tied to the role

Processing this separately from the practical handoff. Both matter.

Two more weeks. Making them count.

A year ago, VPS was 15 people. Today we're 50. Tripling a team while maintaining velocity is its own challenge.

## Hiring at Scale

At 15 → 50, you need 35+ hires in a year:
- That's nearly 3 hires per month
- Assuming 10% offer acceptance, need 30+ offers per month
- Assuming 10% interview-to-offer, need 300+ interviews per month
- Assuming 10% screen-to-interview, need 3000+ candidate screens per month

This is a full-time job for multiple people.

## Hiring Process Evolution

**At 15**: I personally interviewed every candidate
- Deep assessment of each person
- Slow, but maintained quality
- Not scalable

**At 50**: Distributed hiring with calibrated interviewers
- Trained interviewer pool (10+ calibrated interviewers)
- Structured interview loops (consistency)
- Hiring committee reviews (cross-check)
- I meet finalists only (scale my time)

Quality maintained through process, not personal involvement.

## Onboarding Investment

New hire effectiveness timeline:
- Month 1: Learning, consuming
- Month 3: Contributing at 50%
- Month 6: Fully productive

With 3 hires/month, you always have a substantial new hire burden.

Investments:
- Comprehensive documentation
- Mentor/buddy assignments
- Structured ramp-up projects
- Regular check-ins

Onboarding is not a distraction from work - it IS work.

## Organizational Structure

**At 15**: Flat structure, everyone reports to me
**At 50**: Three-level hierarchy

```
Director (me)
├── Engineering Manager 1 (Localization)
│   ├── Tech Lead
│   └── 8 engineers
├── Engineering Manager 2 (Mapping)
│   ├── Tech Lead
│   └── 10 engineers
├── Engineering Manager 3 (Infrastructure)
│   └── 8 engineers
└── Staff engineers (3, cross-cutting)
```

Promoted from within where possible. External EM hires for growth.

## Maintaining Culture

Culture dilutes with growth unless actively maintained:

**Documentation of values**: What we believe, written down
- Bias for action
- User focus
- Quality and craft
- Respectful debate

**Rituals that reinforce**:
- Weekly demos (show working software)
- Post-mortems (learn from failures)
- Recognitions (celebrate what we value)

**Leadership modeling**: I must embody the culture I want.

## Communication Overhead

Meetings scale with team size:
- All-hands (weekly, 50 people)
- EM syncs (twice weekly, 4 people)
- Skip-levels (monthly, rotating)
- 1:1s (weekly with directs, monthly with skips)

Managing meeting load while staying connected is constant work.

## What I Learned

1. **Hire ahead of need**: By the time you need someone, you're already behind.

2. **Invest in managers early**: Good managers are multipliers.

3. **Process enables scale**: What feels like bureaucracy at 15 is essential at 50.

4. **Culture is fragile**: One bad hire can damage culture more than ten good hires can build it.

5. **Let go**: I can't do everything anymore. Trusting others is mandatory.

VPS MVP launched with 50 locations. The roadmap calls for 500 by year end. That's a 10x scaling challenge.

## The Mapping Pipeline

For each location:
1. **Site survey** - Identify mapping area, access, timing
2. **Capture** - Collect imagery with calibrated equipment
3. **Processing** - Run SfM/MVS to create 3D map
4. **QA** - Verify accuracy, completeness, safety
5. **Publishing** - Make available to VPS queries
6. **Maintenance** - Monitor and update as needed

Each step has scaling bottlenecks.

## Capture Scaling

**Current state**: In-house teams with specialized equipment
- Cost: $5,000+ per location
- Time: 1-2 days per location
- Capacity: 10 locations/month

**Scaled approach**: Partner network + consumer devices
- Mapping partners in multiple countries
- Lower-cost capture equipment
- Crowdsourced supplementary imagery
- Target: $500 per location, 100+ locations/month

## Processing Scaling

**Current state**: Manual pipeline with expert oversight
- Processing time: 2-3 days per location
- Human review: 4 hours per location
- Failure rate: 20% require manual intervention

**Scaled approach**: Automated pipeline with exception handling
- Processing time: 8 hours (faster hardware, optimized code)
- Human review: 30 minutes (only exceptions)
- Failure rate: 5% require intervention (better preprocessing)

## QA Scaling

Quality checks:
- **Geometric accuracy**: Does map match reality?
- **Completeness**: Are all important areas covered?
- **Safety**: Are there inappropriate elements?
- **Consistency**: Does it integrate with adjacent maps?

**Current**: Manual review of all outputs
**Scaled**: Automated checks + sampling review

Automated checks catch 90% of issues. Human review for remaining risk.

## Geographic Prioritization

Can't map everywhere immediately. Prioritization:
1. **Developer demand**: Where do partners want to build?
2. **User density**: Where are Quest users?
3. **Strategic locations**: Landmarks, venues, campuses
4. **Capture efficiency**: Clustered locations cheaper than scattered

## Operational Metrics

Tracking:
- **Coverage velocity**: Locations/month
- **Cost efficiency**: $/location
- **Quality rate**: % passing QA first time
- **Time to publish**: Capture to live
- **Partner performance**: Quality and speed by partner

Weekly operational reviews drive improvements.

## The Chicken-and-Egg Problem

Developers want coverage before building.
We want demand before expanding coverage.

Resolution:
- Seed coverage in strategic areas
- Committed partnerships in covered areas
- Demonstrate value to attract more developers
- Developer demand drives expansion

Breaking the cycle requires upfront investment in coverage.

## Lessons from Month 1 of Scaling

- Partner training takes longer than expected
- Local regulations vary significantly by country
- Weather windows are real constraints
- Quality consistency across partners is challenging

Building robust processes before scale is essential.

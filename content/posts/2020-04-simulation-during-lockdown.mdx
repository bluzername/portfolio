Silver lining of the pandemic: simulation investment that seemed "nice to have" is now essential. We can't access labs, but we can access simulated labs.

## The Lockdown Acceleration

Before March 2020:
- Simulation supplemented physical testing
- Real data collection was primary
- Hardware prototyping happened in labs

After March 2020:
- Simulation must substitute for physical testing
- Synthetic data is often the only option
- Hardware simulation enables progress without labs

## Virtual Engineering Expansion

We've expanded simulation beyond training data:

### Sensor Prototyping
Before: Build prototype sensor, test, iterate.
Now: Simulate sensor characteristics, predict performance, iterate in simulation.

Simulating:
- Optical path (ray tracing through lens systems)
- Sensor response (photon-to-electron conversion, noise models)
- Processing pipeline (depth estimation, feature extraction)

Result: Can evaluate sensor design changes in hours, not months.

### System Integration
Before: Integrate components on bench, find issues, debug.
Now: Simulate integrated system, predict issues, fix before hardware exists.

Simulating:
- Timing interactions between sensors
- Data flow bottlenecks
- Failure mode propagation

### Performance Prediction
Before: Profile on target hardware.
Now: Cycle-accurate simulation of target processors.

Not perfect, but good enough to catch major issues before silicon.

## Infrastructure Investments

Accelerated investments:
- **Render farm capacity**: 3x increase in cloud GPU allocation
- **Physics simulation**: License expansion for optical simulation tools
- **Asset library**: More 3D environments, objects, materials
- **Automation**: Better job scheduling, monitoring, analysis

## Limitations We're Hitting

Simulation isn't magic:

**Fidelity ceiling**: No matter how good the simulation, reality surprises.

**Validation gap**: How do you validate a simulation without access to the real thing?

**Tacit knowledge**: Some debugging intuition only comes from physical experience.

**Human factors**: Can't simulate the experience of wearing the device.

## Hybrid Workflow

When we do get lab access (limited, scheduled):
1. Prioritize validation: Use physical testing to validate simulation predictions
2. Collect calibration data: Improve simulation fidelity with real measurements
3. Edge case exploration: Investigate things simulation couldn't predict

## Future State

Post-pandemic, we won't go back to pure physical development:
- Simulation-first for early design phases
- Physical validation for maturity milestones
- Continuous refinement of simulation accuracy

The pandemic forced an evolution we should have made anyway. Virtual engineering is now core to our process.

A depth camera's optical system is where physics meets product requirements. Every choice involves trade-offs that ripple through the entire system.

## Key Parameters

**Field of View (FOV)**: Wider sees more but reduces angular resolution
**F-number**: Lower gathers more light but has shallower depth of field
**Distortion**: Fisheye lenses are compact but complicate calibration
**MTF**: Modulation Transfer Function determines sharpness at different frequencies

## The Wide-Angle Challenge

MR devices want wide FOV (>90°) to track objects entering from periphery. But wide-angle optics are fundamentally challenging:

**Pixel projection**: A 120° FOV on a 640-pixel sensor means each pixel spans ~0.2°. At 5m range, that's 1.7cm per pixel - terrible depth resolution at range.

**Geometric distortion**: Wide angles require strong barrel distortion or physically large lenses. Distortion can exceed 30% at edges.

**Light falloff**: Illumination falloff follows cos⁴θ - edges receive ~25% of center intensity at 60° off-axis.

**Chromatic aberration**: Harder to correct across wide angles, causing color fringing and depth errors.

## Lens Architectures

### Standard Rectilinear
Straight lines stay straight. Familiar, but physically large for wide FOV.

### Fisheye (Equidistant/Equisolid)
Compact, very wide FOV, but strong distortion. Common in VR tracking cameras.

### Freeform
Computer-optimized surfaces that don't follow standard equations. Can achieve better performance but harder to manufacture and align.

## Depth-Specific Considerations

For ToF: lens must transmit NIR efficiently. Many standard glass types absorb at 940nm.

For structured light: lens NA must match illumination cone. Too narrow = vignetting. Too wide = wasted light.

For stereo: matched distortion between cameras simplifies rectification.

## Manufacturing Reality

The best optical design means nothing if it can't be manufactured at scale. We're learning:
- **Tolerance sensitivity analysis** early in design
- **Glass selection** for supply chain availability
- **Assembly alignment** budget allocation

Our optical engineer's mantra: "The best lens is one that can be built."

Next month: bringing it all together in system architecture.

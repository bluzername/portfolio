Nine months independent. I've found a rhythm: consulting for income and connection, building for learning and ownership.

## The Balance

**Consulting (~30%):**
- Spatial computing strategy for startups
- AI architecture for scale-ups
- Advisory for VCs on technical diligence

**Building (~50%):**
- My own products (TrustedChat, market research, bots)
- Experiments and prototypes
- Open source contributions

**Learning (~20%):**
- Staying current on AI developments
- Technical reading and courses
- Community engagement

## Why Consulting Helps Building

**Pattern recognition**: Seeing many companies' problems reveals common patterns.

**Reality check**: Client work grounds my building in real market needs.

**Network**: Client relationships create distribution for what I build.

**Financial runway**: Consulting pays while products find traction.

## Why Building Helps Consulting

**Credibility**: "I built this" > "I advise on this"

**Current skills**: Building keeps technical skills sharp.

**New ideas**: Building surfaces insights I bring to consulting.

**Independence**: My own revenue means I can be selective about clients.

## What I've Learned

### About Consulting
- Scope carefully (scope creep is real)
- Value-based pricing (not hourly)
- Say no to misfit clients (protect energy)
- Document everything (knowledge compounds)

### About Building
- Ship small, iterate fast
- User feedback > perfect plans
- Distribution is as hard as building
- Solo has limits; collaboration helps

### About Balance
- Calendar boundaries matter
- Context switching has cost
- Energy management > time management
- Periodic reassessment needed

## Current Status

**Products with users:**
- TrustedChat (multi-LLM consensus)
- SwingTrade Pro (trading analysis)
- Podcast/News TL;DR bots
- Instagram automation experiments

**Consulting clients:**
- 3 active engagements
- Mix of startup and growth-stage
- Spatial AI and multi-agent focus

**Learning focus:**
- Agent frameworks (LangGraph, etc.)
- New model capabilities
- Emerging patterns

## Looking Forward

The balance feels sustainable. May shift toward more building as products gain traction.

The goal isn't "consulting vs building" - it's building a portfolio of activities that compound.

Year two of independence begins.

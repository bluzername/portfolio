Two weeks ago, we were all in the office. Today, everyone is home. Hardware development doesn't naturally work remotely.

## The Immediate Challenges

**Lab access**: Sensors, prototypes, test equipment are in the office. We're at home.

**Collaboration**: Hardware debugging often means two people looking at the same scope trace. How do you do that remotely?

**Equipment**: Not everyone has home setups capable of running our toolchains.

**Security**: Proprietary hardware can't just go home with people.

## Emergency Adaptations

### Lab-at-Home
Shipped development kits to every engineer who needs them:
- Prototype devices (with tracking)
- Basic test equipment (USB scopes, reference cameras)
- Development boards

Not everything, but enough for most development work.

### Remote Lab Access
For equipment that can't leave:
- VPN access to lab machines
- Remote desktop to oscilloscopes
- Webcams pointed at setups for visual debugging
- "Lab hands" - designated on-site person who can physically manipulate equipment

### Collaboration Tools
Upgraded our tooling:
- Video calls became default (cameras on)
- Screen sharing with annotation
- Virtual whiteboarding for design discussions
- Asynchronous video updates for demos

### Security Protocols
New procedures for hardware at home:
- Asset tracking
- Physical security requirements (locked room)
- Data handling guidelines
- Return procedures

## What Works Better Than Expected

**Focus time**: Fewer interruptions at home. Deep work actually easier.

**Global coordination**: We were already distributed (US/Israel). Adding "home" locations wasn't that different.

**Documentation**: Forced reliance on written communication improved docs.

**Meeting efficiency**: Meetings have agendas now. Less wandering.

## What's Harder

**Informal knowledge transfer**: Can't learn by overhearing conversations.

**Debugging sessions**: Two people staring at a bug together is harder.

**Onboarding**: New team members miss casual context-building.

**Hardware troubleshooting**: "Have you tried power-cycling it?" has a 30-minute shipping delay.

## Team Wellbeing

Beyond productivity, people are struggling:
- Isolation
- Childcare challenges
- Anxiety about the pandemic itself
- Blurred work/life boundaries

Management adaptations:
- More frequent 1:1s
- Explicit permission to flex schedules
- Mental health resources
- Virtual social events (awkward but better than nothing)

## Long-Term Implications

This won't be temporary. We're learning:
- Which activities truly require co-location
- How to structure work for distributed effectiveness
- What tools and processes need investment
- How to maintain culture without physical presence

The playbook we're writing now will outlast the pandemic.

Six weeks ago, "remote hardware development" sounded impossible. Now it's just how we work. Adaptation happens fast when there's no choice.

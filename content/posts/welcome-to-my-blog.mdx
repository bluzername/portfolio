Welcome to my new blog! After two decades of building systems across AI, spatial compute, and cyber — from national-scale intelligence platforms to AR/VR devices shipping to millions — I'm excited to finally have a space to share what I've learned.

## My Journey

My path has been anything but linear:

- **Early career** at the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel, building wireless, DSP, and intelligence systems (and receiving the Prime Minister's Prize for Technological-Operational Achievement along the way)
- **Cyber-security** at Diskin Advanced Technologies, where I led R&D of patented active-defense systems for Fortune-50 companies
- **Mixed-reality hardware** at Magic Leap, directing the architecture of state-of-the-art MR devices and founding the company's synthetic-data team
- **AI & Computer Vision at Meta**, leading the Visual Positioning System (VPS) for worldwide 3D mapping in Quest headsets and Ray-Ban AI glasses

Each of these experiences taught me something different about taking ambitious ideas from whiteboard to deployment at scale.

## What I'll Write About

### Visual Positioning & 3D Mapping

Building systems that understand the physical world in real-time is one of the hardest problems in computer vision. I'll share insights from building Meta's VPS — the challenges of worldwide 3D mapping, 6DoF localization on constrained hardware, and making it all work reliably at scale.

### Synthetic Data & Virtual Engineering

Synthetic data is transforming how we train and validate perception systems. At both Magic Leap and Meta, I pioneered large-scale synthetic data pipelines. I'll explore why this approach is increasingly critical for AI systems and how to do it well.

### Hardware-Software Co-design

Some of my most rewarding work has been at the intersection of hardware constraints and ambitious product experiences. Whether it's eye-tracking optics or perception sensors, the art is in making the physics and the algorithms dance together.

### Multi-Agent Systems & AI-Native Platforms

Today, I'm particularly excited about multi-agent systems and tool-using AI. The architectural patterns for building reliable AI-native platforms are still being discovered — and I have some thoughts.

## A Note on Depth vs. Breadth

I've intentionally moved across many domains over my career. Some might call it unfocused; I call it pattern-matching across scales. The principles of building reliable distributed systems look remarkably similar whether you're working on intelligence platforms, XR devices, or AI agents.

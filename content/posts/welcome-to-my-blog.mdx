Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to finally have a space where I can share my thoughts on technology, software architecture, and the rapidly evolving world of AI.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a range of topics that I'm passionate about:

### Platform Architecture

Having worked at companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Magic Leap, I've gained valuable insights into building scalable, reliable systems. I'll be sharing lessons learned and best practices for architecting modern platforms.

### Synthetic Data & AI

Synthetic data is revolutionizing how we train AI models. I'll explore the latest developments in this space and discuss practical applications.

### Spatial Computing

From my time at Magic Leap, I developed a deep appreciation for the potential of AR/VR. Expect posts about the future of spatial interfaces and immersive experiences.

## Code Examples

I'll also be sharing code examples when relevant. Here's a taste of what that might look like:

```typescript
interface BreakthroughPlatform {
  scalability: "horizontal" | "vertical";
  reliability: number; // 99.99% uptime target
  innovation: string[];
}

const buildPlatform = (requirements: BreakthroughPlatform): Promise<void> => {
  // The magic happens here
  return Promise.resolve();
};
```

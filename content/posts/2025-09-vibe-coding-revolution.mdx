I was skeptical of AI coding assistants. "They'll write buggy code." "You still need to understand everything." "It's just autocomplete."

I was wrong.

## The Transformation

Before AI tools:
- Write code line by line
- Google for syntax and APIs
- Debug through manual inspection
- Slow iteration cycles

With AI tools:
- Describe what I want in natural language
- AI writes first draft
- I review and refine
- Much faster iteration

My output increased ~3x without sacrificing quality.

## Tools I Use Daily

### Claude Code
For complex, multi-file changes:
- Understands project context
- Makes coordinated changes across files
- Explains what it's doing

Perfect for refactoring, new features, debugging.

### Cursor
For in-editor assistance:
- Inline completions while typing
- Quick questions without context switch
- Code explanation on demand

My default editor now.

### ChatGPT/Claude
For conceptual work:
- Architecture discussions
- Algorithm design
- Technology evaluation

Thinking partner, not just code generator.

## Changed Practices

### Prompting is a Skill
Writing good prompts matters:
- Clear requirements
- Relevant context
- Specific constraints
- Expected format

Better prompts = better outputs.

### Review is Critical
AI writes code; I verify it:
- Does it do what I asked?
- Are there edge cases missed?
- Is it the right approach?
- Security implications?

Reviewing AI code is different from reviewing human code.

### Documentation Changed
AI can generate docs from code:
- READMEs from implementations
- Comments from logic
- API docs from signatures

But I still write key architectural decisions myself.

## What AI Can't Do (Yet)

- Deep architectural judgment
- User experience intuition
- Business prioritization
- Novel algorithm invention

AI amplifies; it doesn't replace thinking.

## Implications for the Field

Junior developers: Different skill set needed. "Learning to code" now includes "learning to prompt."

Senior developers: Leverage AI to operate at higher abstraction level.

Teams: Smaller teams can build bigger things.

The economics of software development are shifting. I'm glad to be building in this era.

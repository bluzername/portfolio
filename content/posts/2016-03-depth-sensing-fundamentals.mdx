Depth sensing is the foundation of spatial computing. Without accurate, real-time depth data, you can't place virtual objects on real surfaces, detect collisions, or enable hand tracking. This month I've been deep in the evaluation of depth sensing technologies.

## Time-of-Flight (ToF) Basics

ToF sensors measure the time it takes for light to travel to a surface and back:

```
Distance = (Speed of Light × Time) / 2
```

In practice, we use phase detection rather than direct time measurement. The sensor emits modulated IR light and measures the phase shift of the returned signal.

**Advantages:**
- Works at any distance within range
- Provides full-frame depth in a single shot
- Relatively simple calibration

**Challenges:**
- Multi-path interference in complex scenes
- Flying pixels at depth discontinuities
- Power consumption scales with range

## Structured Light

Structured light projects a known IR pattern and uses triangulation to compute depth from pattern deformation.

**Advantages:**
- Higher accuracy at close range
- Better at sharp depth edges
- Can achieve very high resolution

**Challenges:**
- Accuracy degrades with distance (baseline-limited)
- Struggles with textureless surfaces
- Ambient IR interference (sunlight)

## The MR Trade-off

For MR headsets, we need:
- **Indoor range**: 0.3m - 5m
- **Outdoor capability**: Must handle sunlight
- **Power budget**: under 500mW for the depth subsystem
- **Latency**: under 20ms for responsive interaction

Neither technology is perfect. ToF wins on outdoor robustness and consistent accuracy across distances. Structured light wins on close-range precision for hand tracking.

## Hybrid Approaches

The most promising path forward may be hybrid systems:
- ToF for room-scale understanding and SLAM
- Structured light for near-field hand tracking

The integration complexity is significant - different sensors, different calibrations, different failure modes. But the combination could provide the best of both worlds.

Next month: sensor fusion and how to combine these modalities without doubling power consumption.

V2 planning is underway. The question isn't "what do we want?" but "what did V1 teach us we need?"

## V1 Pain Points (Perception)

From telemetry and user feedback:

**Tracking failures in challenging lighting**: 35% of reported issues
- Users want to use device near windows
- Evening use in dim rooms
- Transitions (walking between rooms)

**Relocalization unreliability**: 12% failure rate
- Maps become stale
- Users don't understand map management
- Content "jumps" unexpectedly

**Hand tracking limitations**: Frequent complaint
- Gesture recognition was cut
- Tracking range too limited
- Performance degrades with occlusion

**Battery life**: Sessions limited by power
- Heavy use drains in 2.5 hours
- Thermal throttling kicks in sooner

## V2 Perception Requirements

### Tracking Robustness
- **Target**: under 1 tracking loss per hour of normal use (10x improvement)
- **Approach**: Better sensors + smarter algorithms + wider operating envelope

### Sensor Upgrades Needed
| V1 | V2 Target | Why |
|----|-----------|-----|
| Tracking cam: 640x480 | 1280x720+ | More features, better low-light |
| Depth: 320x240 ToF | 640x480 | Better meshing, hand tracking |
| Eye cam: 320x320 | 480x480+ | More accurate gaze |
| IMU: 1kHz | 2kHz+ | Better fast motion handling |

### Hand Tracking
- Full gesture recognition (pinch, grab, point, palm)
- Near-range: 20-60cm from face
- Far-range: 40-100cm (arm's length)
- under 5° fingertip accuracy

### Power Budget
- **Target**: Same or better battery life with more capability
- **Approach**: New chip architecture, algorithmic efficiency, smart power management

## Architecture Decisions

**Dedicated ML accelerator**: V1 ran ML on GPU. V2 needs NPU for efficiency.

**More on-device compute**: Cloud isn't reliable enough for real-time. Process locally, sync when possible.

**Sensor-algorithm co-design**: Don't pick sensors then adapt algorithms. Design together.

## What We're Not Changing

Some V1 decisions remain correct:
- Visual-inertial approach for tracking (proven, robust)
- ToF for depth (better outdoor than structured light)
- Stereo tracking cameras (needed for stereo depth backup)

## Timeline Pressure

Chip tape-out is in 6 months. Sensor orders locked in 4 months.

We need requirements finalized NOW for hardware that ships in 2+ years.

The V1 experience helps - we know what matters. But we'll inevitably get some things wrong. Building in flexibility where we can.

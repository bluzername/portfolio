Quest 3 launches later this year. Improved hardware means improved VPS capabilities.

## Hardware Improvements

| Aspect | Quest Pro | Quest 3 |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Passthrough | Color, lower res | Color, higher res |
| Compute | XR2 Gen 1 | XR2 Gen 2 |
| Cameras | Good | Better low-light |
| Price | $1499 | ~$499 |

The price point matters most: 3x more users means 3x more VPS queries.

## VPS Upgrades for Quest 3

### Better Input
Higher-resolution passthrough enables:
- More features per image
- Better feature quality
- Improved matching accuracy

Expected improvement: 15% reduction in localization error.

### More Compute
XR2 Gen 2 enables:
- Faster feature extraction (30ms → 20ms)
- More sophisticated models
- Continuous operation with less power

### MR-First
Quest 3 is designed for MR, not just VR:
- VPS more central to user experience
- Tighter platform integration
- First-party MR apps use VPS

## Scaling Challenges

Quest 3 accessibility means scale:
- Quest Pro: 100K units expected
- Quest 3: Millions of units expected

VPS infrastructure must handle:
- 10x query volume
- 10x map data
- 10x developer demand

Scaling work ongoing.

## New Features for Launch

**Instant localization**: under 100ms when map is on device
**Semantic anchors**: "Attach to table" not just "attach at coordinate"
**Shared experiences**: Multiple devices in same VPS space
**Developer tooling**: Self-serve mapping portal

## Timeline

- Q1: Architecture updates complete
- Q2: Integration with Quest 3 firmware
- Q3: Beta testing and optimization
- Q4: Launch with Quest 3

On track but tight.

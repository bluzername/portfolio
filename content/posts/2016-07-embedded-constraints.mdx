On a server, you optimize for accuracy. On a headset worn on someone's face, you optimize for not burning them.

## The Constraint Triangle

**Power**: Total budget ~5-8W for the entire system (display, compute, sensors, wireless). Perception might get 1-2W.

**Thermal**: The device sits on your face. Surface temperature >41°C causes discomfort. >45°C is a safety issue.

**Latency**: Motion-to-photon must be under 20ms to avoid nausea. Perception is in the critical path.

These constraints are interconnected. Running faster uses more power, generates more heat, throttles the processor, increases latency.

## Algorithm Implications

Algorithms that work beautifully on a desktop GPU may be completely impractical:

### Feature Detection
SIFT: 200ms per frame → Unusable
ORB: 15ms per frame → Marginal
Custom binary descriptors: 3ms → Feasible

### Depth Processing
Full frame bilateral filter: 25ms → Too slow
Sparse depth + interpolation: 5ms → Workable

### SLAM Backend
Full bundle adjustment: 500ms → Background only
Sliding window: 30ms → Near real-time

## Hardware Acceleration

We can't solve this with algorithms alone. Hardware acceleration is essential:

**DSP**: Good for fixed-function pipelines (filtering, feature detection)
**GPU**: Good for parallel workloads (stereo matching, neural networks)
**Custom silicon**: Best efficiency but longest development time

The architecture decision we make now will determine what's possible for the next 5 years.

## The Profiling Discipline

Every engineer on the perception team needs to internalize:
1. Profile before optimizing
2. Measure power, not just time
3. Test on target hardware, not desktop
4. Consider thermal over sustained workloads, not just peak

We're building profiling infrastructure to make this easy. A topic for next month.

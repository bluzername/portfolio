Quest Pro ships next month with VPS integrated into mixed reality. Our biggest launch yet.

## What's Shipping

**VPS in Quest Pro:**
- Continuous localization for MR experiences
- Sub-meter outdoor accuracy
- Integration with Guardian and spatial anchors
- Developer APIs for location-aware apps

**Coverage:**
- 1,000+ outdoor locations globally
- Focus on urban areas, landmarks, campuses
- Indoor: Enterprise partner locations only

## Integration Journey

### Challenges Overcome

**VIO Integration**: Merging VPS with existing tracking was hard.
- Coordinate frame alignment
- Timing synchronization
- Failure mode handling

**Power Optimization**: Continuous VPS was too power-hungry.
- Adaptive query frequency
- Efficient feature extraction
- Smart triggering (don't query when confident)

**Latency Reduction**: 500ms wasn't good enough.
- On-device map caching
- Predictive prefetching
- Optimized network protocol

### Final Performance

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Accuracy | under 1m | 0.7m median |
| Latency | under 200ms | 180ms |
| Power | under 100mW | 85mW |
| Success rate | >90% | 88% |

Close to targets. Good enough to ship.

## Launch Risks

**Coverage gaps**: Many places users will try aren't mapped.
- Mitigation: Clear messaging about coverage
- Fallback: GPS + VIO when no VPS available

**Accuracy variability**: Some conditions still challenging.
- Mitigation: Confidence indication to apps
- Degradation: Don't show anchored content when uncertain

**Privacy concerns**: MR raises new privacy questions.
- Mitigation: Clear privacy controls
- Bystander indicator lights

## Developer Readiness

50+ launch partners have VPS-enabled experiences:
- Museum tours with contextual information
- Outdoor AR games with persistent content
- Campus navigation apps
- Enterprise training applications

Developer feedback informed final APIs.

## Post-Launch Plan

Immediate:
- Monitor telemetry for issues
- Fast-follow bug fixes
- Partner support

30 days:
- Coverage expansion based on usage data
- Performance optimization based on field metrics
- Developer feedback incorporation

90 days:
- Next feature planning (indoor, glasses)
- Crowdsourced mapping general availability
- Quest 3 preparation

## Personal Reflection

Two years from joining Meta to this launch. VPS went from concept to shipping product used by potentially millions of Quest Pro users.

The team delivered. The technology works. Now we see if users care.

Launch is just the beginning.

Quest Pro brings full-color passthrough and mixed reality. VPS needs to level up to match.

## Quest Pro Capabilities

- High-resolution color passthrough cameras
- Better tracking (more cameras, faster IMU)
- Improved processors (more compute available)
- Eye tracking and face tracking

MR mode: Digital content mixed with real world.

## VPS Requirements Shift

### Higher Accuracy Needed
VR: Virtual content in virtual world. Small errors invisible.
MR: Digital content on real surfaces. Errors are jarring.

**VR target**: 10cm accuracy acceptable
**MR target**: 2cm accuracy needed for believable placement

### Lower Latency Needed
VR: Content locked to headset. Latency to world doesn't matter.
MR: Content locked to real world. Latency causes visible drift.

**VR target**: 500ms initial localization fine
**MR target**: under 200ms initial, continuous refinement

### Always-On Requirements
VR: Localize once at session start.
MR: Continuous localization as user moves through space.

Power budget implications: Can't be a power hog if always running.

## Technical Adaptations

### Continuous Localization
VPS becomes part of the tracking pipeline:
```
VIO tracks frame-to-frame
VPS corrects drift periodically
Combined: Accurate + responsive
```

VPS queries every few seconds, not just at startup.

### Tighter Integration
VPS and VIO share information:
- VIO provides motion prior to VPS
- VPS provides absolute correction to VIO
- Kalman filter combines both

Previously separate systems, now fused.

### Quality of Service
MR needs predictable performance:
- Bounded latency (no 5-second queries)
- Graceful degradation (don't freeze on failure)
- Confidence indication (know when uncertain)

## Development Timeline

Quest Pro ships October 2022.
VPS MR support target: Launch readiness for Quest Pro.

We have 6 months. It's aggressive but achievable.

Key milestones:
- Q1: Architecture for continuous localization
- Q2: Integration with VIO team
- Q3: Performance optimization
- Q4: Polish and launch

## The Opportunity

Quest Pro positions VPS as core infrastructure:
- Every MR experience potentially uses VPS
- Pre-installed on millions of devices
- Foundation for spatial computing future

Higher stakes, higher visibility, higher impact.

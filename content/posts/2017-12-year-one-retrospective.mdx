A year ago I joined Magic Leap knowing almost nothing about mixed reality. Today I lead the perception architecture for a device that's actually taking shape. Time for honest reflection.

## What Went Well

### Technical Foundation
We have working systems:
- Visual-inertial odometry running at 60Hz with under 1mm tracking error
- ToF depth sensor integrated and calibrated
- Eye tracking prototype showing promising accuracy
- Synthetic data pipeline generating training data

The architecture decisions from early 2017 are proving sound.

### Team Growth
Started with 3 engineers, now have 15 across perception disciplines:
- Strong technical hires who are already contributing
- Culture of demo-driven development
- Cross-functional collaboration improving

### Synthetic Data Bet
The synthetic data team is already accelerating our ML development. Training eye tracking models on synthetic data is working better than I expected.

## What Didn't Go Well

### Schedule Optimism
We underestimated integration complexity. Individual components working doesn't mean the system works. Integration bugs consumed Q3-Q4.

Lesson: add 50% to integration estimates, minimum.

### Hardware-Software Handoff
Communication gaps between hardware (optics, sensors) and software (algorithms) teams caused rework. Specs that seemed clear weren't.

Lesson: written specs aren't enough. Need working prototypes across the boundary.

### Power Budget Overrun
We're 30% over power budget. Every subsystem optimized locally, but the sum exceeds the system constraint. Now doing painful trade-offs.

Lesson: track power continuously at system level, not just per-component.

## Biggest Learnings

### Perception is a System Problem
You can't optimize depth sensing without considering SLAM. You can't optimize SLAM without considering display latency. Everything connects.

### Data is Strategy
The team that controls data generation controls algorithm development velocity. Synthetic data is strategic infrastructure.

### Embedded is Different
Algorithms that work on desktop often can't be translated to embedded. Design for target platform from day one.

### Calibration is Half the Work
Brilliant algorithms don't matter if calibration is wrong. Invest in calibration infrastructure early.

## Looking Ahead to 2018

Priorities:
1. **Ship developer kit**: Real devices in real developers' hands
2. **Power optimization**: Get back within budget
3. **Synthetic data scaling**: 10x current generation capacity
4. **Hand tracking**: Add hands as input modality

It's going to be intense. But we're building something real. That's energizing.

Thanks to everyone on the team who made this year possible. Onward.

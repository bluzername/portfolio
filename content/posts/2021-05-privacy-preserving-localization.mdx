VPS knows where you are. That's its job. But it shouldn't know more than necessary, and that information shouldn't be exploitable.

## Privacy Threats

### Location History
Sequential VPS queries reveal movement patterns:
- Where you go
- When you go there
- How long you stay

### Image Content
Images sent for localization could reveal:
- People you're with
- Activities you're doing
- Private spaces

### Aggregation
Even anonymous data, aggregated, reveals patterns:
- Popular locations
- Traffic flows
- Gathering patterns

## Defense: On-Device Processing

First principle: images never leave the device.

```
Camera → On-Device Feature Extraction → Features → Cloud
         (full image here)              (no image content)
```

Features are designed to be non-invertible:
- Can match to map, but can't reconstruct original image
- Tested with adversarial image reconstruction attacks
- Acceptable leakage: general scene type (indoor/outdoor), not specific content

## Defense: Minimal Collection

Only collect what's needed:
- Features, not images
- Approximate location, not precise trajectory
- Session ID, not user ID

Retention policy:
- Query features deleted immediately after localization
- Aggregate statistics retained for service improvement
- No personal location history stored

## Defense: Differential Privacy

Add calibrated noise to prevent individual identification:

For location aggregates:
```
True count + Noise(scale=ε) = Published count
```

Guarantees: can't determine if any individual was present.

For feature matching:
```
True match score + Noise = Reported score
```

Prevents precise timing inference while maintaining localization function.

## Defense: User Control

Users must have meaningful control:
- Clear opt-in for VPS features
- Easy opt-out without losing device function
- Data download (see what we have)
- Data deletion (remove all traces)

## Auditing and Verification

How do users trust our claims?
- Regular third-party privacy audits
- Open-source privacy components (where possible)
- Bug bounty for privacy vulnerabilities
- Transparency reports on data requests

## The Performance Trade-off

Privacy measures have costs:
- On-device processing uses more battery
- Differential privacy reduces accuracy
- Limited collection prevents some features

We accept these costs. Privacy is a feature, not a bug.

## Regulatory Landscape

GDPR, CCPA, and emerging regulations shape our design:
- Data minimization (collect minimum necessary)
- Purpose limitation (use only for stated purpose)
- Storage limitation (delete when not needed)
- User rights (access, correction, deletion)

Building compliance in, not bolting it on.

Meta is launching smart glasses with Ray-Ban. While VPS isn't in V1, we're planning for future integration. Very different constraints from Quest.

## Ray-Ban vs Quest

| Aspect | Quest | Smart Glasses |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Form factor | Headset (500g) | Glasses (50g) |
| Compute | Snapdragon XR2 | Low-power SoC |
| Camera | Wide-angle stereo | Small forward-facing |
| Battery | 3-4 hours active | All-day target |
| Use case | Immersive XR | Ambient assist |

The power and compute constraints are dramatically tighter.

## Smart Glasses VPS Requirements

**Power budget**: Under 10mW average (vs. 150mW on Quest)
- Can't run continuous feature extraction
- Must be event-triggered, not continuous

**Camera quality**: Consumer-grade, fixed focus
- Lower resolution
- More noise
- Less controlled viewpoint

**Use cases**: Different from Quest
- Navigation assistance
- POI information
- Contextual reminders
- Social sharing location

Doesn't need VIO-level continuous tracking. Occasional localization is sufficient.

## Sparse Localization Architecture

Instead of continuous VPS, trigger on events:
- User requests location context
- Significant location change detected (GPS)
- App requires precise location
- Periodic background check

Query pattern: Once per minute, not 60 times per second.

This dramatically changes the architecture:
- Latency less critical (1-2 seconds acceptable)
- Power per query can be higher
- Cloud processing more acceptable
- On-device simplicity valued

## Sensor Adaptation

Smart glasses camera is different:
- Forward-facing only (no stereo, no rear cameras)
- Smaller sensor (more noise)
- Fixed focus (outdoor optimized)
- Lower frame rate

Need features robust to:
- Single-view geometry
- Motion blur (head movement during capture)
- Variable focus quality

Training specifically for this sensor profile.

## Privacy Sensitivity

Glasses are more privacy-sensitive than headsets:
- Worn in public constantly
- Less obvious when capturing
- Bystander awareness concerns

Extra precautions:
- Explicit visual indicator during capture
- Stricter limits on capture frequency
- Enhanced face blurring in processing

## Timeline

Ray-Ban Stories V1: No VPS (ships late 2021)
Future generation: VPS integration target

Using V1 period to:
- Understand real sensor characteristics
- Collect (consented) data for training
- Refine ultra-low-power algorithms
- Build glasses-specific map layers

Preparing for a future where glasses have spatial awareness.

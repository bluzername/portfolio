We have working sensors in the lab. Now we need to make 100,000 of them. The challenges are completely different.

## Prototype vs Production Mindset

In prototyping:
- Hand-tuned calibration
- Best-in-class components
- Unlimited debug time
- Sample size: 1

In production:
- Automated calibration (seconds per unit)
- Cost-optimized components
- Diagnosis in seconds
- Every unit must work

## Yield: The Defining Metric

Yield = (Good units) / (Total units manufactured)

At $50 component cost and 80% yield:
- Effective cost = $50 / 0.8 = $62.50 per good unit
- 20% scrap cost adds up to millions at scale

At 95% yield:
- Effective cost = $50 / 0.95 = $52.63 per good unit

That 15% yield improvement might be worth more than any other optimization.

## Sources of Yield Loss

**Component variation**: Every resistor, capacitor, optical element has tolerance
- Resistors: ±1% is common
- Optical elements: ±5% on transmission is good
- Combined: distributions multiply

**Assembly variation**: Placement accuracy, bond quality, contamination
- Pick-and-place: ±50μm typical
- Die attach: thermal interface quality varies
- Cleanliness: particles in optical path

**Process variation**: Temperature, humidity, equipment drift
- Reflow profiles vary oven-to-oven
- Adhesive cure varies with batch

## Design for Manufacturing (DFM)

Choices we made for manufacturability:

**Wider tolerances where possible**: If algorithm can handle ±10% depth error, don't specify ±5% sensor calibration.

**Testability**: Every subsystem must be independently testable. Can't debug what you can't probe.

**Redundancy**: If one sensor fails calibration, can we reroute to a spare? Built-in flexibility.

**Binary pass/fail**: Clear criteria, no subjective decisions on the line.

## Calibration at Scale

Our lab calibration takes 30 minutes per unit. Production target: 30 seconds.

How:
- **Parallel calibration**: Calibrate multiple parameters simultaneously
- **Known-good reference**: Calibrate against golden units, not absolute standards
- **Statistical shortcuts**: Some parameters can be inferred from others
- **Post-assembly trimming**: Adjust in firmware what hardware can't deliver

## Quality Escapes

What happens when a bad unit reaches a customer?

- Field failure → customer frustration → returns → reputation damage
- Cost of one field failure = 100x cost of factory catch

Invest heavily in outgoing quality control (OQC):
- 100% functional test
- Sample environmental stress screening
- Accelerated life testing on samples

## Learning from the Line

Production data is gold:
- Calibration parameters → track component suppliers
- Test failures → feed back to design
- Customer returns → find escapes in testing

We've built dashboards tracking key metrics in real-time. Manufacturing problems visible within hours, not weeks.

Production ramp is Q3. We'll learn a lot more soon.

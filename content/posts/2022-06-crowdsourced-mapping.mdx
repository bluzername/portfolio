Professional mapping doesn't scale. There are millions of places people want AR experiences; we can't map them all ourselves. Users must contribute.

## The Vision

Any Quest user can contribute to mapping:
1. Opt in to contribution program
2. Device captures during normal use
3. Captures uploaded (privacy-preserved)
4. Aggregated into maps
5. Maps available for VPS

Everyone benefits from collective mapping.

## Privacy Architecture

Users contributing data need strong privacy guarantees:

### On-Device Processing
Raw images never leave device:
- Extract features on-device
- Remove identifying information (faces, screens)
- Compress to minimal representation

### Differential Privacy
Can't determine if specific user contributed:
- Aggregate contributions before storage
- Add noise to prevent individual identification
- Minimum contribution thresholds

### User Control
- Clear opt-in (not default)
- Contribution visibility (see what you've shared)
- Revocation (delete your contributions)
- Geographic limits (don't map near home)

## Quality Challenges

User contributions vary wildly:
- Motion blur from casual capture
- Poor lighting conditions
- Obstructed views
- Duplicate coverage

Quality pipeline:
1. **Filtering**: Reject unusable captures
2. **Scoring**: Rank captures by quality
3. **Selection**: Choose best for mapping
4. **Validation**: Verify accuracy before publishing

90% of contributions are filtered out. The 10% are gold.

## Incentive Design

Why would users contribute?

**Intrinsic**: Help build the AR future
**Social**: Recognition for contributions
**Utility**: Better maps where you care about
**Gamification**: Achievements, progress bars

Avoid:
- Payment (attracts gaming)
- Mandatory contribution (ethics)

## Coverage Strategy

Crowdsourced maps complement professional maps:
- Professional: High-value, high-traffic locations
- Crowdsourced: Long-tail, user-specific locations

User contributions fill gaps professionals can't reach economically.

## Results So Far

Beta program (10,000 users):
- 1M+ contributions received
- 50K passed quality filter
- 100 new locations mapped (that we couldn't otherwise)
- User satisfaction: 78% would recommend

Scaling to general availability in 2023.

## Learnings

1. **Privacy concerns are real**: Many users opt out due to privacy worry. Must earn trust.

2. **Quality bar matters**: Low-quality maps hurt more than help.

3. **Feedback loops work**: Users who see their contributions used contribute more.

4. **Long-tail is long**: Most contributions are from few users. Engagement is challenging.

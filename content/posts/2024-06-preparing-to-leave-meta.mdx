I've decided to leave Meta in September. Four years, a platform built, a team developed. Time for the next chapter.

## Why Now

**The work is successful**: VPS is running, scaling, valued. My job isn't to keep it running - others can do that.

**The learning slowed**: Year 4 taught less than Year 1. I'm optimizing, not pioneering.

**The AI moment**: We're in a transformational period. I want to be building new things, not maintaining existing ones.

**Energy for change**: I have energy for a new challenge. Better to leave with energy than stay until depleted.

## What I'm Leaving

**A working system**: VPS serves millions of queries daily, reliably.

**A strong team**: 75 people who don't need me to succeed.

**Career capital**: Director-level at Meta is a strong position.

**Certainty**: I know how to do this job well.

## What I'm Seeking

**AI-native building**: Products designed around AI from the start, not AI added to existing products.

**Smaller scale**: More direct impact, less coordination overhead.

**Frontier problems**: Unsolved challenges, not optimization of solved ones.

**Ownership**: My decisions, my outcomes.

## The Options

**Big company AI team**: Google, Apple, OpenAI - similar scale, different problems
**Startup**: Join or start something new
**Independent**: Consulting, investing, building

Leaning toward independent + building. Want flexibility to explore before committing.

## Emotional Processing

**Grief**: Leaving something I built from scratch
**Excitement**: New possibilities ahead
**Fear**: What if I'm wrong?
**Gratitude**: Four transformative years

All these feelings are valid. Sitting with them rather than rushing through.

## The Handoff

Three months to transition:
- Document everything not written down
- Transfer relationships
- Complete in-flight projects
- Say proper goodbyes

Leaving well matters for the team and for my integrity.

## What's Constant

Regardless of what's next:
- Spatial computing expertise travels
- AI/ML skills are universal
- Leadership experience applies anywhere
- Network persists across roles

The foundation is solid. Now to build something new on it.

Last quarter at Meta begins.

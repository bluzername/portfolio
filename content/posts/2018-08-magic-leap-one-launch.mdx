Magic Leap One Creator Edition is shipping today. After two and a half years, the device is real and going to customers.

## What We Shipped

The perception system in every Magic Leap One includes:
- **6DoF head tracking**: Visual-inertial odometry at 60Hz, under 1mm accuracy indoors
- **Spatial mapping**: Real-time 3D mesh generation
- **Plane detection**: Horizontal and vertical surfaces for content placement
- **Eye tracking**: Gaze vector for foveated rendering and interaction
- **Image tracking**: Fiducial markers for spatial anchors

Each of these was a research problem when I started. Each is now a production feature.

## What Went Right

**Synthetic data investment paid off**: Our eye tracking and hand tracking models benefit enormously from procedural data generation. We couldn't have collected enough real data.

**Calibration infrastructure**: The production calibration system works. Yield is above target. Quality is consistent.

**Sensor architecture choices**: ToF depth and global shutter tracking cameras were the right calls. We're not fighting sensor limitations.

**Team resilience**: The final push was brutal, but the team held together. Nobody burned out catastrophically.

## What Went Wrong

**Outdoor performance**: SLAM doesn't work reliably outside. We knew this, but hoped to solve it. We didn't. It's a known limitation.

**Power consumption**: We're higher than spec. Battery life is shorter than we wanted. Thermal throttling kicks in sooner than ideal.

**Hand tracking scope**: Gesture recognition was cut. Users get basic hand tracking but not the natural interaction we envisioned.

**Polish gap**: Many edge cases have rough edges. The core works, but it doesn't feel finished in the way Apple products do.

## Market Reality

The reviews are... mixed. The technology is impressive. The price ($2,295) is high. The content ecosystem is thin. The form factor is chunky.

We built what we could build. The market will decide if it's enough.

## What I Learned

**Shipping is a muscle**: You only learn to ship by shipping. All the planning, process, and preparation matter less than the experience of actually getting something out the door.

**Hardware is unforgiving**: Software bugs can be patched. Hardware ships with its limitations baked in. The decisions we made in 2016 determined what was possible in 2018.

**The goal isn't the device**: The goal is enabling experiences that weren't possible before. The device is necessary but not sufficient.

## What's Next

For the product:
- Software updates to improve tracking
- Content partnerships to fill the experience gap
- Iteration toward V2 with lessons learned

For me:
- Shifting focus from V1 firefighting to V2 architecture
- Scaling the synthetic data platform
- Developing the next generation of perception capabilities

We shipped. Now the real work begins.

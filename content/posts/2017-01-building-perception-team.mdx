With specs frozen, execution becomes everything. And execution is people. This month I've been focused on building out the perception team.

## The Skill Matrix

Perception sits at an unusual intersection:

| Domain | Expertise Needed |
|--------|------------------|
| Computer Vision | SLAM, 3D reconstruction, feature detection |
| Machine Learning | CNNs, optimization, deployment |
| Optics | Lens design, illumination, calibration |
| Embedded Systems | DSP, real-time, power optimization |
| Systems Engineering | Integration, testing, requirements |

Finding people who are deep in one area AND can communicate across boundaries is the challenge.

## Hiring Principles

**T-shaped engineers**: Deep in one domain, broad understanding of adjacent areas. A CV engineer who understands sensor noise models. An embedded engineer who groks the algorithms they're optimizing.

**Prototype-oriented**: Academic publications are nice, but I want to see working code. Take-home projects over whiteboard puzzles.

**Intellectual honesty**: The work is hard. I need people who say "I don't know" and "I was wrong." Ego-driven engineers create technical debt.

**System thinkers**: Can they trace a requirement from user need through algorithm to hardware constraint? Most can't.

## Team Structure

We're organizing around deliverables, not disciplines:

```
Perception Team
├── Tracking (VIO/SLAM)
│   ├── CV Engineer
│   ├── Embedded Engineer
│   └── Systems Engineer
├── Depth
│   ├── Sensor Lead (optics + electronics)
│   ├── Algorithm Engineer
│   └── Test Engineer
├── Eye Tracking
│   ├── CV Engineer
│   ├── Optics Engineer
│   └── Embedded Engineer
└── Infrastructure
    ├── Simulation Engineer
    ├── Tooling Engineer
    └── DevOps
```

Each pod owns their feature end-to-end. Cross-cutting concerns (calibration, testing, profiling) handled by Infrastructure.

## Cultural Foundations

Establishing norms early:
- **Weekly demos**: Show working systems, not slides
- **Blameless post-mortems**: When things break (they will), learn without finger-pointing
- **Direct feedback**: Say it in the room, not after
- **Documentation as artifact**: If it's not written down, it doesn't exist

## Challenges

Hiring in Israel for MR is competitive. Everyone wants the same CV/ML engineers. Our pitch: work on problems that ship to millions, not research prototypes.

We're also competing with ourselves - the US team needs the same skills. Establishing clear ownership boundaries is ongoing.

Next month: onboarding and getting new hires productive.

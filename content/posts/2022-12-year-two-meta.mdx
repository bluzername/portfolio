Two years since joining Meta. VPS shipped on Quest Pro. The team grew to 80. Looking back and forward.

## The Arc

**July 2020**: Joined as IC, one of 5 on nascent VPS team
**December 2020**: Leading VPS engineering, team of 15
**June 2021**: MVP launched to developers
**December 2021**: Team of 50, expanded coverage
**October 2022**: Quest Pro integration shipped
**December 2022**: Team of 80, VPS as platform

From zero to platform in 29 months.

## Key Accomplishments

**Technical**:
- Working visual localization at scale
- Neural map compression
- Privacy-preserving architecture
- Crowdsourced mapping pipeline

**Product**:
- Shipped in Quest Pro
- 1000+ mapped locations
- 100+ developer partners
- Growing daily active users

**Team**:
- 5 → 80 people
- Three strong engineering managers
- Culture of shipping and quality

## What I Learned

**About Meta**: Resources are real, but so is complexity. Getting alignment across orgs is the hardest part.

**About scale**: Problems at scale are qualitatively different. Solutions that work at 10 fail at 10,000.

**About leadership**: My job shifted from solving problems to ensuring problems get solved. Letting go is essential.

**About platforms**: Platforms are different from products. Developer experience matters as much as end-user experience.

## Challenges Remaining

**Indoor**: Still not production-ready. Harder than expected.

**Economics**: Mapping still too expensive. Need 10x improvement.

**Adoption**: Developers want more coverage before committing.

**Competition**: Google, Apple building similar capabilities.

## Looking to 2023

**Technical bets**:
- Indoor localization launch
- Next-gen learned features
- Real-time map updates

**Product focus**:
- Quest 3 integration
- Ray-Ban AI glasses exploration
- Developer self-service tools

**Team evolution**:
- Consolidation (not growth)
- Senior technical depth
- Cross-functional capabilities

## Personal State

**Energy**: Still high. The problems are interesting.

**Growth**: Learning rate has slowed. Seeking new challenges.

**Balance**: Better than Year 1. Sustainable pace.

VPS is on solid footing. The question is whether there's more I can contribute here, or whether it's time to apply these skills elsewhere.

Not leaving yet. But thinking about what's next.

Our perception team spans Florida and Israel. 7 time zones apart. Making this work requires intentional structure.

## The Timezone Challenge

Israel: GMT+2/+3
Florida: GMT-4/-5
Gap: 9-10 hours

When Israel ends their day (6pm), Florida is just starting (9am).
When Florida ends (6pm), Israel is sleeping (3am).

Overlap window: ~2-3 hours on a good day.

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous (Overlap Hours)
- Daily standups (15 min)
- Technical deep dives
- Decision meetings
- Live debugging sessions

Guard this time fiercely. No routine meetings during overlap.

### Asynchronous (Everything Else)
- Written design documents
- Recorded demos
- Issue tracker discussions
- Pull request reviews

Default to async. If it can be written, write it.

## Documentation Culture

Global teams can't rely on hallway conversations. Documentation becomes infrastructure:

**Design docs**: Every significant change gets a written proposal
- Problem statement
- Proposed solution
- Alternatives considered
- Open questions

**Decision records**: When we decide something, document why
- Context at time of decision
- Options considered
- Rationale for choice
- What would change our mind

**Meeting notes**: Every meeting produces written summary
- Decisions made
- Action items (with owners and dates)
- Open questions for async discussion

## Building Trust Remotely

Trust is harder without casual interactions:

**Video by default**: Seeing faces builds connection. Cameras on.

**Informal touchpoints**: Weekly "coffee chat" video calls with no agenda.

**In-person investment**: Quarterly visits in each direction. Worth the cost.

**Explicit appreciation**: Recognition that would be casual in-office needs to be deliberate remotely.

**Assuming good intent**: When message seems curt, assume timezone fatigue, not hostility.

## Ownership Clarity

Ambiguous ownership kills distributed teams. Clear divisions:

| Israel Owns | US Owns | Shared |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Synthetic data | SLAM | Integration |
| Eye tracking | Mapping | API design |
| Sensor eval | Hand tracking | Architecture |
| Calibration | ML infra | Release |

When ownership is shared, decision authority is explicit.

## What Doesn't Work

**Expecting real-time response**: If you message someone and they're asleep, wait.

**Synchronous-first defaults**: Scheduling meetings across 9 time zones for every discussion.

**Hidden context**: Decisions made in local meetings without documentation.

**Separate backlogs**: One team's priorities invisible to the other.

## Our Rhythm

- **Daily async standup**: Written update by end of local day
- **Weekly technical sync**: All senior engineers, video, overlap hours
- **Bi-weekly all-hands**: Full team, recorded for async viewing
- **Monthly planning**: Align priorities, allocate resources
- **Quarterly visits**: Build relationships in person

It's not perfect. Nothing replaces being in the same room. But with discipline, global teams can execute at high velocity.

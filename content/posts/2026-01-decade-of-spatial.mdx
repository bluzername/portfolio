Ten years ago this month, I joined Magic Leap. I knew nothing about AR/VR. A decade later, I've helped build systems used by millions and watched an industry mature.

## The Arc of Spatial Computing

### 2016: Hype and Promise
- Magic Leap raising billions
- VR "Year of VR" (it wasn't)
- Pokémon Go hinted at consumer AR
- Technology not ready for mainstream

### 2018-2019: Reality Check
- Magic Leap One shipped (didn't transform the world)
- VR found niche in gaming
- Enterprise AR emerged
- Hardware limitations became clear

### 2020-2022: Pandemic Pivot
- Remote work drove VR adoption
- Quest 2 reached mass market
- Meta bet big on metaverse
- COVID accelerated digital transformation

### 2023-2024: Maturation
- Quest 3 achieved good enough MR
- Smart glasses returned (Ray-Ban Meta)
- Apple entered with Vision Pro
- Spatial computing became real, if not universal

### 2025-2026: Convergence with AI
- LLMs transformed what devices can do
- AI glasses more useful than AR glasses
- Multimodal AI understands space
- Computation moves to the edge

## What Changed

**Hardware**: From prototype to consumer product. Weight, power, and cost improved dramatically.

**Software**: From research demos to production platforms. VPS, spatial anchors, hand tracking all work.

**Use cases**: From "anything is possible" to "these specific things work." Reality narrowed the vision.

**Economics**: From VC hype to sustainable business models. Hardware subsidized by software/services.

## What Didn't Change

**Human factors**: People still don't want things on their face for long. Form factor remains the constraint.

**Social norms**: Wearing a headset in public is still weird. Cameras on glasses raise privacy concerns.

**Killer app**: Still waiting for the iPhone moment. Gaming is good but not transformative.

## Personal Journey

2016: Junior engineer learning everything
2018: Leading perception for a shipping product
2020: Building at Meta scale
2024: Independent, applying expertise to new domains

The field grew, and I grew with it.

## What's Next for Spatial

**Prediction 1**: AI makes glasses useful before AR does. Understanding scenes matters more than overlaying pixels.

**Prediction 2**: Spatial computing goes ambient. Less "strap this on" more "it's built in."

**Prediction 3**: The enterprise-consumer boundary blurs. Same devices, different apps.

**Prediction 4**: Privacy becomes the differentiator. Who you trust with spatial data matters.

## Gratitude

To everyone who built this field alongside me:
- Magic Leap colleagues who shipped the impossible
- Meta teammates who scaled to millions
- The broader community pushing the frontier

Ten years of building. Looking forward to ten more.

The world changes. New buildings appear, old ones are demolished. Stores rebrand, signs get updated. Seasons cycle. Our maps must keep up.

## The Staleness Problem

Map captured: January 2021
User queries: December 2021

In between:
- Construction changed building facade
- Seasonal foliage blocked features
- Street furniture was moved
- Business signs updated

If >30% of features changed, localization may fail.

## Change Detection

### Query-Time Detection
When user query doesn't match map well:
- Low inlier ratio → something changed
- Inconsistent matches → partial changes
- High reprojection error → systematic shift

Can detect but not fix during query.

### Proactive Monitoring
Periodic re-capture or user contribution:
- Schedule re-capture for high-value areas
- Collect user images (with consent) as passive monitoring
- Compare new captures to existing map

### Automated Analysis
Detect changes without ground truth:
- Feature stability: Which features persist across time?
- Semantic consistency: Building still looks like building?
- Geometric consistency: Structure matches expected?

## Handling Changes

### Graceful Degradation
When map is stale:
- Return lower confidence score
- Fall back to GPS if confidence too low
- Suggest user contribute updated imagery

### Multi-Temporal Maps
Store multiple versions:
- Seasonal variants (winter vs summer)
- Time-of-day variants (day vs night)
- Historical versions for change tracking

Query matches against appropriate variant.

### Continuous Refinement
Update maps incrementally:
- New observations refine existing structure
- Change detection triggers re-mapping
- Automated quality checks before publishing

## Economic Considerations

Re-mapping isn't free:
- Capture cost (vehicles, people, storage)
- Processing cost (compute for SfM/MVS)
- Validation cost (QA, review)

Prioritization strategy:
- High-traffic areas updated frequently
- Popular AR experience locations prioritized
- User-reported staleness triggers review
- Budget allocation by expected value

## The Seasonal Challenge

Seasonal changes are predictable but dramatic:
- Deciduous trees: Full foliage → bare branches
- Snow cover: Completely changes appearance
- Sun angle: Different shadows throughout year

Options:
- Seasonal map variants (expensive, multiplies storage)
- Season-invariant features (research direction)
- Semantic matching (match building, not texture)

Currently exploring season-invariant feature learning.

## Success Metrics

Tracking freshness:
- Map age distribution (how old are our maps?)
- Change rate by area (how fast do different regions change?)
- Localization success vs map age (correlation?)
- User-reported staleness incidents

Target: under 5% of queries affected by stale maps.
